A small planner/reminder tui application

Wanted to do this for a long time, but also got inspiration from dear Mister Azozin (https://github.com/rexim/tore)

How to use:

o - add a new item on the same level
a - add a new item as a child
Enter - submit new item's name
j - move down
k - move up
c - change item's name
Enter - mark item as done
Tab - collapse an item
q - exit

- [ ] Configuration/customization
- [ ] Actually do something when a line is too long
- [ ] Recurring tasks
