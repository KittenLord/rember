a small tui planner, that'll look something like this

- [2/4] thing a
    - [ ] task 1
    - [x] task 2
    - [1/2] task 3
        - [x] subtask 1
        - [ ] subtask 2
    - [x] task 4


keybinds:

o - new task of the same hierarchy level
a - new child task
c - change name of the task
d - delete task
Enter - tick/untick task
Tab - collapse/reveal task

ideas:

possibly multiple tabs, opened on 1 2 3 etc
